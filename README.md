Just a simple inventory management API.

To use it, first install dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

Then run the application:
```sh
node index
```

You can then access it through a [web browser](localhost:3000/api).
```sh
localhost:3000/api
```

Planned classes:

*This is a draft version, and classes names are likely to be renamed.*
